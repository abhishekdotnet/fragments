            Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. He is
            the strongest hunter in the world and the second Shadow Monarch,
            having inherited the position from his predecessor Ashborn.
            Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, Jinwoo got the chance
            of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System,
            giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint.
            As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him
            by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's
            greatest hunter.<br />

            Jinwoo is a tall, handsome, and muscular young man with gray eyes,
            sharp facial features, and black hair with bangs that dangle all the
            way down to his eyes. When using his powers or feeling intense
            emotions, his eyes glow purple and his facial features become more
            pronounced.

            Cha Hae-In (차해인) is a Korean S-Rank Hunter and the Vice-Guild
            Master of the Hunters Guild. She is also the wife of Sung Jinwoo and

            Hae-In is an attractive young woman with gray eyes and blonde hair
            in a bob cut. She is short in stature with a slender build and large
            chest. She typically wears red-themed armor on raids and carries a
            black sword with a silver hilt. When using her abilities, her eyes
            glow yellow.
